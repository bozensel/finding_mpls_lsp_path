How to find out if a path is changed for specific lsp

MPLS:

Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS), is a tried and true networking technology that has powered enterprise networks for over two decades. Unlike other network protocols that route traffic based on source and destination address, MPLS routes traffic based on predetermined “labels”. 

Businesses use MPLS to connect remote branch offices that require access to data or applications that reside in the organization's data center or company headquarters.

LSP: 

LSP, label switched path (LSP) is a path through an MPLS network, set up by a signaling protocol, such as LDP, RSVP TE, BGP or CR-LDP.

Python Difflib:

Difflib is a Python module that contains several easy-to-use functions and classes that allow users to compare sets of data. The module presents the results of these sequence comparisons in a human-readable format, utilizing deltas to display the differences more cleanly.
